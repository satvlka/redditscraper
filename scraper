Accessing and extracting data from websites, including Reddit, requires working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Reddit provides an API through which you can retrieve information, including comments. Please note that you should always check and adhere to Reddit's API usage policies.

To achieve your goal, you'll need to use the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library to interact with Reddit's API, and the `pandas` library to handle data and export it to an Excel sheet. If you haven't installed these libraries yet, you can do so by running:

```bash

pip install praw pandas

```

Here's a simple Python script that demonstrates how to extract comments from a specified subreddit and export them to an Excel sheet:

```python

import praw

import pandas as pd

# Set up your Reddit API credentials

reddit = praw.Reddit(

client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',

client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',

user_agent='YOUR_USER_AGENT'

)

# Specify the subreddit and the number of comments to retrieve

subreddit_name = 'python'

num_comments_to_fetch = 10

# Fetch the subreddit

subreddit = reddit.subreddit(subreddit_name)

# Fetch the top submissions from the subreddit

top_submissions = subreddit.top(limit=num_comments_to_fetch)

# Create empty lists to store comments and related information

comments_list = []

# Iterate through the top submissions and collect comments

for submission in top_submissions:

submission.comments.replace_more(limit=None)

for comment in submission.comments.list():

comments_list.append([comment.id, comment.body, comment.score])

# Create a DataFrame from the collected comments

columns = ['Comment ID', 'Comment Body', 'Comment Score']

comments_df = pd.DataFrame(comments_list, columns=columns)

# Export the DataFrame to an Excel file

excel_file_path = 'reddit_comments.xlsx'

comments_df.to_excel(excel_file_path, index=False)

print(f"Comments extracted and saved to {excel_file_path}")

```

Replace `'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'`, `'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'`, and `'YOUR_USER_AGENT'` with your actual Reddit API credentials. You can obtain these credentials by creating a Reddit app on the Reddit developer portal.

Keep in mind that using Reddit's API has rate limits, so be sure to review Reddit's API documentation for more information on usage limits and guidelines: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/data-api-terms
